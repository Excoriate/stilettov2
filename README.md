Stiletto (means "dagger" in Italian) is a portable, and containerized pipelines that runs everywhere, since it works on top of the wonderful
[Dagger](https://dagger.io). Its main motivation is to provide a simple way to run pipelines in a portable way, and also to provide a way to run
pipelines in a containerized way, so you can run your pipelines in any environment, and also in any CI/CD platform.
Stiletto follows the same principles as [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions) in the way that it defines a pipeline, its jobs and actions; nevertheless, **it's not a 'portable' version of GH actions**.


## Roadmap 🗓️

- [ ] Enable workflows (`workflow.yml`) for more complex pipelines.
- [ ] Cover necessary/critical parts of Stiletto with proper unit tests.
- [ ] Add an official DockerFile that can be available in [DockerHub](https://hub.docker.com/).
- [ ] Add an API to trigger Stiletto for automatic pipelines through _internal developer portals_ or other interfaces.
